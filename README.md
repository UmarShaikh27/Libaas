# Libaas

A fully functional front-end website of an online clothing store. This website was the final project of my front-end development certification from Jawan Pakistan. It uses
HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap library. The website also reflecsts on the UI and UX understanding I have.

The code can be easily run on any compiler thet supports HTML5 css and js.
